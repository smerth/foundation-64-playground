# Icon Navigation from Data

This icon navigation is built from a series of buttons generated by an `{{#each }}` loop and panini.  The data for the buttons is contained in `data/iconnav.yml`.

The clever bit is applying the `.active` class using `{{#ifpage }}`.  `{{#ifpage}}` exposes the page variable, if we set the page variable in the yaml data for each item we can add the `.active` class to the links matching the page being processed.

In this demo the buttons don't do anything but could be linked up to MixItUp or Isotope to sort data on the pageâ€¦ to demonstrate the active class without building out the rest of the page I have just added a link to another page called "coffee".
